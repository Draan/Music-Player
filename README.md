# Draan's Musical Control For Mindflayers Who Lost Their Tentacles After Experimenting With Fire
A simply music player for playing music during D&D. The index.html creates a list of options based on files.js.
It then writes the currently playing file to data.txt using update.php.

The client (client.html) reads the file and loads it into it's own html5 audio element.

It works ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
